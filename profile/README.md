# Birchmount Robotics Club
Birchmount Robotics Club, also known as B(ro)botics, is the robotics club of Birchmount Park C.I., in Scarborough, ON. Our team identifier in V5RC is `41977B`.

## What do we do?
We design and build [VEX V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5) robots to compete in the [Vex Robotics Competition (VRC)](https://www.vexrobotics.com/competition). Our team is a diverse group of talented people who all share a passion for robotics. Some are into programming, while others are into building. This is where we do the former.

## Achievements
Between Over Under (2023-24) and High Stakes (2024-2025), our team improved a lot. We recently got second place in a qualifier for Provincials, and proceeded to perform reasonably well there.
